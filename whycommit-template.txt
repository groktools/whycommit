Why

# This paragraph should explain the "why" behind the code change.
# It should explain why the code change was done to a future reader.

# All features and bugs require code changes, so this section should NOT
# have the original request as the "why".
# Instead, explain why these changes were chosen from the set of possible
# solution options.
