Title (under 50 characters)

# The title should fill this blank: "If applied, this change will ________".
Omit the "If applied" part, however, since the title will show up in short
displays.

Why: This paragraph should explain the "why" behind the code change. Not why you
made the change, but why the changes that were made were the right changes to
make for the requirements of the feature or bug to be met.

What: This paragraph should explain what was changed. Enumerate logical
components that were changed as part of this commit.

# Omit the "how" of the commit, i.e., how you changed the code. This should be
obvious from the diff itself. See http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ for
more details on this format.
